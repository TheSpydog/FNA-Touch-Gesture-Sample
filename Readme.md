This is a simple demo showing off FNA's new touch gesture features, based on (Nick Gravelyn's XNA TouchGestureSample)[http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/gestures]. Use this to test the touch functionality on your favorite FNA-supported, touch-enabled device.

Building the project currently requires (my FNA fork)[https://github.com/TheSpydog/FNA/tree/touch] to get all the Touch goodness. If you don't want to go through the hassle, just run the binary in the /bin directory.
