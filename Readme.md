### FNA TouchGestureSample ###

This is a simple demo showing off FNA's new touch gesture features, based on [Nick Gravelyn's XNA Touch Gesture Sample](http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/gestures). Use this to test the touch functionality on your favorite FNA-supported, touch-enabled device.

Building the project currently requires [my FNA fork](https://github.com/TheSpydog/FNA/tree/touch) to get all the Touch goodness. If you don't want to go through the hassle, just run the .exe in the Binaries directory.
